# Grapevine

## Description

Grapevine is a cutting-edge application designed to transform the way you explore global cities. Our mission is to provide users with comprehensive information about their chosen travel destination before they arrive, allowing them to plan their trips effectively and efficiently.

Grapevine employs a number of APIs, including Mapbox for dynamic, interactive maps and a proprietary city information API to furnish users with extensive details about selected cities. This data can include information like overall city ratings, safety stats, climate, and much more, ensuring you're in the know before you go.

Leveraging the Bulma CSS Framework and Mapbox GL JS for map generation, Grapevine presents a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface that makes city exploration a breeze.

### Main Features:

1. Search: When a user selects a city from the dropdown menu, the system fetches data about that location.
2. City Information Display: The fetched data is displayed, providing the user with comprehensive information about their selected city. This could include details like overall city ratings, safety stats, climate, and more.
3. Interactive Map: An interactive Mapbox map is displayed based on the selected city, giving the user a visual perspective of the location.

Though our main feature currently involves providing extensive city information, Grapevine's functionality and coverage have a vast potential for expansion. Keep an eye out for updates as we continue to grow and enhance our offerings!
