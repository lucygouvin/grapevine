# Grapevine

## Description

Grapevine is an innovative app designed to revolutionize the house hunting experience in Philadelphia. Our purpose is to provide prospective real estate buyers and renters with comprehensive property history information, aiding them in making well-informed decisions.

Utilizing data integration from Zillow and the City of Philadelphiaâ€™s public records through the OpenDataPhilly API, Grapevine furnishes users with extensive details about available properties. From traditional property attributes such as size and price to historical data like crime rates, presence of asbestos or bedbugs, and building code violations, we've got you covered.

Grapevine leverages the Bulma CSS Framework for a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface that enhances navigation and user trust.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

1. Search (HTML Page 1): When a user searches for a neighborhood within Philadelphia, the system fetches available Zillow listings for that area.
2. Listings Display (HTML Page 2): Users are presented with information about available listings, including pictures, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and pricing.
3. Property History (HTML Page 3 or Modal): When a user selects a listing, they are presented with comprehensive property history information from OpenDataPhilly. This could include details like type of parking available, crime history in the area, presence of asbestos or bedbugs, and any building code violations recorded for the property.

While our MVP is focused on providing property history for Philadelphia, the potential to expand Grapevine's functionality and geographic coverage is immense. Stay tuned for updates as we continue to grow and improve our offerings!
